<h1>Reconnaissance in Penetration Testing</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Reconnaissance is a crucial initial phase in penetration testing. It involves gathering information about a target to identify vulnerabilities and systems that can be exploited. This phase can be either passive, involving information gathering without direct interaction, or active, which involves engaging directly with the system. The objective is to gather enough information to effectively plan and execute a penetration test.
