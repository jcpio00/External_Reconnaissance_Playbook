<h1>External Reconnaissance in Penetration Testing</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        External reconnaissance is a key phase in penetration testing focused on collecting data about a target from outside its network. This passive information gathering phase aims to uncover vulnerabilities, systems, and services that could be exploited, without alerting the target. Techniques involve analyzing publicly available information to construct a comprehensive overview of the target's digital footprint.
