# Reconnaissance in Penetration Testing

## Introduction
Reconnaissance is a crucial initial phase in penetration testing. It involves gathering information about a target to identify vulnerabilities and systems that can be exploited. Reconnaissance can be passive, where the tester collects information without interacting with the target, or active, involving direct interaction. This phase lays the groundwork for effective penetration testing by identifying key targets and planning the attack strategy.

## Objectives
- Identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Discover services and systems.
- Plan effective penetration tests.
